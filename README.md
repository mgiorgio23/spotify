# Spotify App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It was intended to perform more data analysis on listening trends, but unfortunately the API doesn't
support metrics that would be useful in this project. Instead, a UI was made to mimic Spotify desktop functionality.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
